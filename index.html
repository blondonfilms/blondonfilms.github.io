<h2>TWEETABLE ME</h2>
<p>
I love: Being a parent (of 3). Tasting new coffee, beer, tequilas and restaurants (Lvl. 8 Google Guide). Taking pics of beautiful things. Helping amazing people connect.
</p>
<p>
I do: Marketing campaigns. Events to inspire, learn and connect. Design innovation and digitization methodologies. Sometimes write about tech and the digital world. 
</p>
